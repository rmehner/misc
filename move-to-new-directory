# While this can be used at the command line, it was intended to be used

# I've often found myself creating a new directory, naming it, then moving a
# bunch of files into it. This changes that workflow to simply selecting a
# bunch of files, invoking the script and giving it the name of a directory.
# It may not be immediately obvious how, but this script has saved me an
# immense amount of time.
